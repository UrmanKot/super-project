<h2>Manufacturing Module Instruction</h2>

<h3>PLANS</h3>

<p>
  During the production of a new product or assembly, simultaneously with the formation of the
  production list, it generates the corresponding production plan - a hierarchical representation of the
  product structure with the status of each position and the ability to graphically display production
  sequences, the date of receipt of each position, the ability to specify the employee who will be
  engaged in the production of this position and create orders in outsourcing and own production.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  In the plans menu, we are presented with all the plans that are currently in production. There are
  two types - a hierarchy, where we see which specific product this plan applies to, or just a list.
  To open a specific plan, select it from the list and click the selected plans button.
  It is also possible to see all current plans at once in one window. To do this, click the all plans
  button.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  Inside the plan, we see the structure of the product or assembly sent to production. Opposite each
  position there is a graphical representation of the state of each technology of this position - tasks.
  Position status is displayed in color:
  -green - the item is in stock and reserved for this plan
  -red - the item is out of stock. For purchase items with this status, a purchase request is
  automatically generated. For manufactured parts and assemblies, it is necessary to form an order for
  outsourcing or for your own production.
  -yellow — the order for the item has been generated. If this is an order for purchase or outsourcing,
  the date of receipt will be automatically displayed on the plan calendar, for items in own
  production, you must manually specify the date of receipt.
  - yellow-red striped - the order was sent for rework from QC
</p>

<p>
  In addition to color statuses, on the chart we see a calendar for receiving positions in the warehouse.
  If the date of receipt of a child position is shifted, then the parent positions will be shifted after it
  automatically.
  To specify the dates of production of positions of your production, you need to drag the mouse over
  the right or left edge of the rectangle that displays the status of the technology of the desired
  position, or left-click on it and explicitly specify the dates in the pop-up window. Also in the pop-up
  window, you can specify the employee to complete this task and the time he needs, as well as the
  machine needed to complete this task.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="assets/images/instructions/production/3.jpg">
</p>

<p>
  Also in the pop-up window, we can see a marker, whether this task is unlocked for the order. A task
  can only be sent to an order when all of its child elements have a green status, i.e. received at the
  warehouse. Until this moment, the task is blocked for the order.
</p>

<p>
  To create an order, there is an order creation button in the lower left corner. When you click on this
  button, you need to filter the technologies that need to be sent to the order. When filtering, only
  tasks already unlocked for orders will be selected.
  After selecting specific items for the order, you must specify the type of order - outsourcing or your
  own production. If necessary, add materials from the warehouse necessary for the production of
  these positions and click the create button.
</p>

<p>
  <img src="assets/images/instructions/production/4.jpg">
</p>

<p>
  After that, an order with the selected type will be created and a production request for this order will
  be generated at the warehouse.
</p>

<p>
  To simplify planning, there is a planning button in the lower left corner. It allows you to put down
  dates and select employees for many selected tasks at once. To do this, click on the planning button,
  filter the required technologies, specify the required values for all selected tasks.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  After the plan is formed, it is possible to edit the structure of this plan, delete and add positions. In
  this case, this edit does not affect the structure of the product from which this plan was generated,
  but only changes this instance of the product or assembly. To delete a position, click on the
  technology of the desired position and click the delete button in the pop-up window. When deleting
  a position, a reservation is also made for a certain position in the warehouse.
  To add an item, you need to click on the add items button in the lower left corner, select the item
  type, find the desired item in the warehouse, enter the required quantity and click the add button.
  The number is entered per assembly and will be automatically multiplied by the number of
  assemblies for the given plan.
</p>

<p>
  When adding a position, the warehouse quantity is automatically checked and the required quantity
  is reserved from the warehouse, or, if the position is in short supply and is purchased, a request for
  the purchase of this position is automatically generated.
  When adding an item to an assembly that has already been sent to an order, in this order the added
  item appears in the list of required materials and in the production request.
  When deleting an item from an assembly sent to an order, it will also be deleted from the required
  materials of the order, if the production request has not yet been closed. If the production request
  has already been closed, the position cannot be deleted.
  If the item was added to the assembly, the order for which is already closed, this order will be sent
  to the rework.
</p>

<p>
  Also in the bottom menu there are additional filters for this plan
</p>

</p>

<p>If we need to see the availability schedule for several plans at once, or we need to create an order
  for several plans at once, we can use the ALL plans menu. When you go to this menu, we will see
  all the plans in one window. You can filter only the plans we need and work with them in the same
  way as with one plan.
</p>

<h3>ORDERS TO OWN PRODUCTION</h3>

<p>
  The list of all orders to your production contains the order id, the date of creation, the name of the
  plan from which the order was generated and the status of the order
</p>

<p>
  <img src="assets/images/instructions/production/8.jpg">
</p>

<p>
  If the order was created from several plans, both of them will be displayed in the list.
  Order status:
  - new - new order
  - production request completed - the production request was prepared by the warehouse and sent to
  production
  - sent to qc – order items were sent to qc
  - on stock – order items were taken to the warehouse
</p>

<p>
  The order card contains a list of ordered items - the ordered items table, a list of materials and parts
  necessary for the production of ordered items - parts\materials list, a list of machines needed for
  production - machines and a list of technological equipment.
  The materials\parts list is sent to the warehouse as a production request for this order when an order
  is formed. After preparing this list in the warehouse, production can proceed to the order
</p>

<p>
  <img src="assets/images/instructions/production/9.jpg">
</p>

<p>
  It is possible to add a material or a warehouse item to an order. To do this, select the ordered item
  for which additional materials are required and select these materials from the warehouse.
</p>

<p>

<p>
  After the order items are ready, you need to select them from the list and send them to QC.
  Next to each position, its status of passing QC is registered.

<h3>Slice task menu</h3>

<p>
  When planning a plan, a task card is filled in for positions indicating an employee for positions sent
  to their production. The slice tasks menu displays a list of tasks assigned to an employee with the
  ability to filter by various criteria.
</p>

<h3>TOOL REQUESTS</h3>

<p>
  The module is designed to track equipment and tools issued to employees
</p>

<p>
  Areas - we form a list of locators, employees or other storage places for which we will generate requests for
  equipment and tools.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  Instrument and tools - a list of equipment and instruments already given to a specific locator
</p>

<p>
  <img src="assets/images/instructions/production/17.jpg">
</p>

<p>
  Tool request - the formation of a new request for a warehouse for equipment or tools. You must specify where the
  request is assigned and the list of requested positions. After that, this request goes to the warehouse.
